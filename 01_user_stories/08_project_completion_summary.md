## üìä Development Roadmap

### **Sprint Breakdown (10 weeks total):**

| Sprint | Duration | Story Points | Focus Area | Key Deliverables |
|--------|----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Sprint 1** | Weeks 1-2 | 18 pts | Foundation | Authentication, PDF processing setup |
| **Sprint 2** | Weeks 3-4 | 20 pts | Core Integration | User registration, AI integration |
| **Sprint 3** | Weeks 5-6 | 21 pts | PDF & Questions | Upload UI, question processing |
| **Sprint 4** | Weeks 7-8 | 29 pts | Management & Testing | Question management, test taking |
| **Sprint 5** | Weeks 9-10 | 26 pts | Grading & Results | Auto-grading, results viewing |

### **Critical Path Stories (10 total):**
- Must be completed sequentially as they block other development
- Include core infrastructure, AI integration, and grading systems
- Represent the backbone of the MVP functionality

### **Parallel Development Opportunities:**
