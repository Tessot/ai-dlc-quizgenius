## 4.1 PDF Text Extraction Stories

### Story 4.1.1: Extract Text from PDF
**As the** system  
**I need to** extract readable text from uploaded PDF files  
**So that** the content can be processed for question generation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an instructor uploads a text-based PDF file
- When the system processes the PDF
- Then it extracts all readable text content
- And it preserves the structure and formatting where possible
- And it handles multiple pages correctly
- And it returns an error if no text can be extracted

### Story 4.1.2: Validate PDF Content Quality
**As the** system  
**I need to** validate that extracted PDF content is suitable for question generation  
**So that** only quality content is processed by the AI

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given text has been extracted from a PDF
- When the system validates the content
- Then it checks for minimum text length requirements
- And it identifies if the content contains educational material
- And it filters out headers, footers, and page numbers
- And it provides feedback on content quality to the instructor

## 4.2 AI Question Generation Processing Stories

### Story 4.2.1: Generate Questions Using Amazon Bedrock
**As the** system  
**I need to** use Amazon Bedrock to generate quiz questions from PDF content  
**So that** instructors can create assessments automatically

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given validated PDF text content is available
- When the system calls Amazon Bedrock for question generation
- Then it sends the content with appropriate prompts
- And it specifies the desired question types (multiple choice, true/false)
- And it receives structured question data in response
- And it handles API rate limits and errors appropriately

### Story 4.2.2: Process Multiple Choice Question Generation
**As the** system  
**I need to** generate well-formed multiple choice questions  
**So that** students have clear options to choose from

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the AI is generating multiple choice questions
- When processing the content
- Then each question has exactly one correct answer
- And each question has 3-4 plausible distractors (incorrect options)
- And all options are clearly distinct from each other
- And questions are based on factual content from the PDF
- And the correct answer is properly identified

### Story 4.2.3: Process True/False Question Generation
**As the** system  
**I need to** generate accurate true/false questions  
**So that** students can evaluate statements based on the content

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the AI is generating true/false questions
- When processing the content
- Then each statement is clearly true or false based on the PDF content
- And statements avoid ambiguous or opinion-based content
- And the correct answer (true/false) is properly identified
- And questions test understanding rather than memorization

## 4.3 Auto-Grading System Stories

### Story 4.3.1: Grade Multiple Choice Questions
**As the** system  
**I need to** automatically grade multiple choice questions  
**So that** students receive immediate feedback on their performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a student has submitted answers to multiple choice questions
- When the system processes the submission
- Then it compares each answer to the stored correct answer
- And it marks each question as correct or incorrect
- And it calculates the total score as a percentage
- And it stores the results in the database

### Story 4.3.2: Grade True/False Questions
**As the** system  
**I need to** automatically grade true/false questions  
**So that** students receive immediate feedback on their performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a student has submitted answers to true/false questions
- When the system processes the submission
- Then it compares each answer to the stored correct answer (true/false)
- And it marks each question as correct or incorrect
- And it includes these results in the overall score calculation
- And it stores the results in the database

### Story 4.3.3: Calculate and Store Test Results
**As the** system  
**I need to** calculate comprehensive test results  
**So that** both students and instructors can view detailed performance data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given all questions in a test have been graded
- When calculating final results
- Then it computes the total score (points and percentage)
- And it records the completion time
- And it stores individual question results
- And it timestamps the test completion
- And it associates results with the correct student and test
