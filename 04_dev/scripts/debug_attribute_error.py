    Mathematics is a fundamental subject that deals with numbers, quantities, and shapes. 
    Basic arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    For example, 2 + 2 = 4, and 3 √ó 5 = 15. The area of a circle is calculated using the formula œÄ √ó r¬≤, 
    where r is the radius. Geometry involves the study of shapes, angles, and spatial relationships.
    A triangle has three sides and three angles, and the sum of interior angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.
    Algebra uses variables and equations to solve problems. For instance, if x + 5 = 10, then x = 5.
    Fractions represent parts of a whole, such as 1/2 or 3/4. Percentages are another way to express fractions,
    where 50% equals 1/2 and 75% equals 3/4. Understanding these basic concepts is essential for more advanced
    mathematical topics like calculus, statistics, and trigonometry.
