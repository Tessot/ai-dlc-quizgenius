  - False: "False", "false", "F", "f", "No", "no", "N", "n", "0"
- Default to False for unknown values
- Case-insensitive processing

#### Score Calculation
- Points-based scoring (1 point per question)
- Percentage calculation: (earned/possible) * 100
- Pass/fail determination based on test passing score
- Time calculation from start to submission
- Comprehensive statistics (correct, incorrect, unanswered)
