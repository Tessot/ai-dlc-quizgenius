# AI Question Generation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Question Generation feature is a core component of the QuizGenius MVP that enables instructors to automatically generate high-quality multiple choice and true/false questions from PDF content using AWS Bedrock AI services. This feature transforms uploaded PDF documents into educational assessments by leveraging advanced language models to analyze content and create relevant, pedagogically sound questions.

The system must process PDF content, validate its educational suitability, generate questions with appropriate difficulty levels, and provide quality feedback to ensure the generated questions meet educational standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: PDF Content Processing for Question Generation

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want to process uploaded PDF content for AI question generation, so that the system can analyze and prepare the content for creating relevant educational questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an instructor uploads a PDF document THEN the system SHALL extract and process the text content for question generation
2. WHEN PDF content is processed THEN the system SHALL chunk the content into logical sections suitable for question generation
3. WHEN content is chunked THEN the system SHALL analyze each chunk for topic identification and difficulty estimation
4. WHEN content analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide metadata about the processed content including word count, topics, and estimated difficulty
5. IF the PDF content is insufficient for question generation THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about content requirements
6. WHEN content processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 2: AI Question Generation with Bedrock

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want the system to generate multiple choice and true/false questions from my PDF content using AI, so that I can quickly create comprehensive assessments without manual question writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processed PDF content is available THEN the system SHALL generate multiple choice questions using AWS Bedrock AI services
2. WHEN generating multiple choice questions THEN the system SHALL create questions with one correct answer and three plausible distractors
3. WHEN processed PDF content is available THEN the system SHALL generate true/false questions with clear, unambiguous statements
4. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL ensure questions are directly based on the source content
5. WHEN AI generation is complete THEN the system SHALL validate the structure and quality of generated questions
6. IF question generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with adjusted parameters and provide fallback options
7. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL provide metadata including difficulty level, topic, and source content reference

### Requirement 3: Content Quality Validation

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want the system to validate the quality of my PDF content and generated questions, so that I can ensure the educational value and appropriateness of the assessment materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF content is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate the text length meets minimum requirements for question generation
2. WHEN content is analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect and score educational content quality
3. WHEN content quality is assessed THEN the system SHALL provide a quality score and specific feedback
4. WHEN content is unsuitable for question generation THEN the system SHALL filter it out and explain why
5. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL validate question structure, clarity, and educational value
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for content or question improvements
7. IF content quality is below threshold THEN the system SHALL suggest specific improvements or alternative approaches

### Requirement 4: Question Generation Configuration

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want to configure question generation parameters, so that I can control the type, quantity, and difficulty of questions generated from my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating question generation THEN the system SHALL allow instructors to specify the number of questions to generate
2. WHEN configuring generation THEN the system SHALL allow selection of question types (multiple choice, true/false, or both)
3. WHEN setting parameters THEN the system SHALL allow difficulty level preferences (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
4. WHEN generation parameters are set THEN the system SHALL validate the feasibility based on available content
5. IF requested parameters exceed content capacity THEN the system SHALL suggest adjusted parameters
6. WHEN generation is configured THEN the system SHALL provide estimated generation time and question count

### Requirement 5: Question Generation Results Management

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want to review and manage the AI-generated questions, so that I can ensure quality and make necessary adjustments before creating tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN question generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display all generated questions in a reviewable format
2. WHEN displaying questions THEN the system SHALL show question text, answer options, correct answers, and metadata
3. WHEN questions are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide quality indicators and confidence scores
4. WHEN reviewing questions THEN the system SHALL allow instructors to accept, reject, or flag questions for editing
5. WHEN questions are processed THEN the system SHALL store accepted questions in the database for test creation
6. WHEN generation results are saved THEN the system SHALL provide statistics about generation success rates and quality metrics

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want the system to handle errors gracefully during question generation, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN content processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested solutions
3. WHEN question generation partially fails THEN the system SHALL save successful questions and report failed attempts
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. IF generation completely fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative approaches or manual question creation options
6. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL allow users to retry generation with the same or modified parameters

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want question generation to complete in a reasonable time, so that I can efficiently create assessments without long delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL process content and generate questions within 2 minutes for typical documents
2. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates and estimated completion time
3. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL handle content chunking efficiently without memory issues
4. WHEN multiple users generate questions simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance for all users
5. IF generation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide status updates and allow cancellation
6. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and optimization suggestions
