### 🟡 Minor Enhancements Needed

#### A. Enhanced Session Management
**Gap**: User stories imply session persistence, but data model could be more explicit
**Recommendation**: Add session tracking fields to user model
```json
"session_info": {
  "current_session_id": "sess_12345",
  "last_activity": "2024-01-20T14:22:00Z",
  "session_timeout": 3600
}
```

#### B. Test Attempt Limits
**Gap**: User stories mention "max_attempts" but enforcement tracking could be clearer
**Current**: `max_attempts` in test configuration ✅
**Enhancement**: Add attempt counter validation in data access patterns

#### C. Question Pool Management
**Gap**: User stories don't explicitly mention question pools, but data model includes them
**Status**: Forward-compatible design ✅
**Note**: Question pools are included but not required for MVP

### 🔍 Data Access Pattern Validation

#### Query Efficiency Analysis:
- **User lookup**: Single partition key access ✅
- **Question retrieval**: GSI on creator_id ✅
- **Test browsing**: GSI on status for published tests ✅
- **Student results**: GSI on student_id for attempt history ✅
- **Instructor analytics**: GSI on test_id for result aggregation ✅

#### Performance Considerations:
- All critical user journeys have optimized access patterns ✅
- Batch operations supported for question generation ✅
- Efficient querying for reporting and analytics ✅
