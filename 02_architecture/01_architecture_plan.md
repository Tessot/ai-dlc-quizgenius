- Enable rapid development with clear separation of concerns

## Technical Requirements (Final Architecture)
- **Application Framework**: Streamlit (single application)
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito integration with Streamlit session management
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB for scalable data persistence
- **AI Integration**: Amazon Bedrock for question generation
- **PDF Processing**: AWS Bedrock Data Automation for text extraction
- **Question Types**: Multiple choice and true/false only
- **Access Model**: Open access (students can take any published test)
- **User Roles**: Instructor and Student roles only
- **Deployment**: AWS-native architecture for production scalability

## Architecture Decisions (Based on Your Requirements)

### ‚úÖ **Confirmed Decisions:**
1. **Diagramming Format**: ASCII diagrams (simple, text-based)
2. **Application Framework**: Streamlit (single application, local execution)
3. **PDF Processing**: AWS Bedrock Data Automation for text extraction
4. **Real-time Features**: Simple request-response (no real-time features for MVP)
5. **Analytics Depth**: Basic (just scores and completion status)
6. **Technology Stack**: Python with Streamlit (no separate frontend/backend)
7. **Deployment**: Local laptop execution with future AWS migration consideration

### üìã **Architecture Implications:**
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single Streamlit application with local data storage
- **Minimal External Dependencies**: Only AWS Bedrock for AI services
- **Local Development Focus**: Easy to run and test on laptop
